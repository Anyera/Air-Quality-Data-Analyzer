# Air-Quality-Data-Analyzer
Basic Octave Scripts used to analyze Particulate matter, Temperature and Humidity Data collected from Air Quality sensors in Nairobi Kenya, finding their various correlations.
The Script reads csv files from CfA Data and Muthurwa Data once unpacked;
finding their means maximums and correlations before plotting their graphs.

The script Data_CfA/Data Characterization must be placed in the same workspace as the unpacked csv files.

The Script is very basic made to make it easier to analyse the data for the air quality project and further developments onto it will be made.
